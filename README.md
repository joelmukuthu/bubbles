# bubbles
> a simple web-based multiplayer game built with [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and web sockets (using [socket.io](http://socket.io/ "socket.io")).

Once you join the game, you get a bubble (an orange actually) which has you name on it. You can move the bubble around within the arena and you can also pin and unpin it by clicking on it.

## Installation

1. Install [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/) with `npm`
2. Download the code (clone or download archive) to a directory on your computer
3. In a terminal/console/command prompt window, change to the directory and run `npm install` to set everything up

## Running

1. In a terminal/console/command prompt window, change to the directory where the code is and run `node app`. The app also supports a *delayed* mode of playing which you can run by `PLAY_MODE=delayed node app`. Try  them both and see the difference.
2. Open a browser and point it to `http://localhost:3000`
